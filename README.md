# Return the maximum and minimum difference values by an array

Given two arrays of integers (arr1,arr2). 

Your task is going to find a pair of numbers(an element in arr1, and another element in arr2), where their difference in value is as big as possible. 

Again, you should find a pair of numbers, their difference in value is as small as possible.

## Return the maximum and minimum difference values by an array:
``[ max difference, min difference ]``

### For example:


`Given arr1 = [3,10,5], arr2 = [20,7,15,8]
 should return [17,2]
 because
 20 - 3 = 17, (max difference) 10 - 8 = 2 (min difference)`
